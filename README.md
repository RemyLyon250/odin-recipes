# odin-recipes
The project I created is a web page dedicated to selling computers. I designed the page using HTML and some basic navigation elements. Here's a breakdown of what I accomplished:

HTML Structure: I used HTML to structure the web page. The <html> tag encapsulates the entire document, and the <head> section contains meta-information and the title of the page, which is "Selling Computers." The actual content of the page is placed within the <body> tag.

Main Heading: I included a prominent heading using the <h1> tag, which displays the text "odin-recipes." In this case, I might want to replace "odin-recipes" with "Selling Computers" or another suitable title that reflects the purpose of the project.

Image Display: To visually enhance the page, I added an image using the <img> tag. However, I need to make sure the image source (src attribute) points to the correct location. Currently, the image source is set to  which is a local file path on my computer. I should replace it with a URL pointing to an online image or ensure that the image file is accessible to anyone visiting the web page.

Navigation Menu: I created a navigation menu using the <nav> tag. It includes three links represented by <a> tags:

"Computers-Tech": This link, when clicked, should lead to a page or section specifically dedicated to computers and technology.
"Support-tech": Clicking on this link should direct users to a page providing technical support or assistance related to the offered computer products.
"About Us": This link should take users to a page providing information about the project or the organization behind it.

By completing this project, I have demonstrated my proficiency in HTML to create a basic web page structure, incorporate an image, and implement a simple navigation menu. However, to make the project fully functional, I need to further develop the linked pages (e.g., "computers.html," "support.html," and "about.html") to provide meaningful content and specific features related to selling computers.

Overall, this project serves as a starting point that can be expanded upon to create a comprehensive website for selling computers, including product listings, detailed descriptions, pricing information, and a seamless user experience.
